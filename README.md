# SearchAndTagBot
ECE 4180 Design Project


This project is the culmination of a few different ideas.

Drawing inspiration from the mapping bot done by a prior 4180 group to use infrared sensor to map and store information on where certain targets are located.

Using Google Cloud Vision Api to develop a protocol for filtering colors in a live image stream, and then tagging those targets.

Leveraging the bluetooth on the raspberry pi to use a teleoperated mannuevering approach with Bluetooth app for the smartphone
